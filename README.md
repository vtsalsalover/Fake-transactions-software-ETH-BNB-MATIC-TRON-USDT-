**Official telegram channel** - [https://t.me/fake_sender](https://t.me/fake_sender) 



Brief description of the software:

The software is calculated on the victim's inattention, when for example the victim sends money to someone, then at once both the sender and the recipient is sent the amount in response from an identical address,
the calculation is that the next time the victim will copy our wallet, as it is identical to the one sent initially.

The principle of work of the software:

* Finds transactions in the blockchain of all popular coins (ETH, BNB, MATIC, TRON, USDT)
* Selects wallets that have money on them (e.g. 10,000$) and send the amount to another wallet (e.g. 5,000$).
* The software creates a similar wallet of the recipient and sender and sends 0,001$ to each of them.
* Saves tokens of all created wallets
* Software checks all wallets for $$$$
* All values, amounts can be edited in config

Screens:
The top transaction is ours, the bottom one was made by the victim.
The addresses are identical at the beginning and at the end so that the victim accidentally dropped the money in the wrong place. (That's us)

**The software checks to whom it is going to send the transaction and if it sees that it is an exchanger or a stock exchange, it does not perform the process of sending the transaction. 
This is done so that the software sends transactions only to real users and not to services in order to avoid unnecessary costs.**
